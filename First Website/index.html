        <h1>THE LEGEND OF NUMBER '7'</h1>
        <p class="legend_7_text">Folklore and football are intertwined. There is probably no other
          game in the world that has more history and tradition than football. And a part of that
          tradition is jersey numbers. The first time numbers were used in Europe was in 1928 by the
          likes of Arsenal and Chelsea. Since then, these numbers have become an iconic tradition and
          some of them have acquired a special significance. The most mythical and historical of these
